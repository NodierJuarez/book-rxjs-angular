# PruebaBooks

Small library management system with Mock API

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/books`.

**Note:** Before running the development server, make sure to start the mock service.

### Starting the Mock Service

To run the mock service, open a new terminal window in the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm run mock:server
```



## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
